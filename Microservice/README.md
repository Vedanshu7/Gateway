#1.	What is microservices?

	Microservices is a type of architecture which allows the creation of Loosely coupled and Highly maintainable application means it is a collection of Independent services. whole project separated by their different actions so the any action can highly maintain and if required service can have API calls for access of other services. Through which it can achieve the dependency of other services.

#2.	Challenges with monolithic oriented architecture?

	So it is very difficult to handle the whole architecture in the conventional monolithic oriented architecture when the project size is huge, it can only be coded in one form of structure, it does not support the other architecture or in hybrid architecture it is hard to solve conflict when there are multiple resources are used by multiple entities and also to change the code is very difficult because of large code dependency and for update whole application needs to redeploy and the most applicable challenge is size of the project if project size will increase then the initial load for server will increase and the load time for end user will increase that might affect the business.

#3.	Any three advantage and disadvantage of microservices

	Advantages:

•	The architecture of microservices allows each microservice to be implemented independently. As a result, for complex systems, it makes continuous deployment possible.
•	It helps a developer who is focused on that service to build each service independently.
•	As developers are free to choose whatever technologies make sense for their service and not bound to the choices made at the beginning of the project, it reduces the difficulty of implementing new technologies.

	Disadvantages:

•	So, this approach is hard to implement because it uses the distributed database so if the project needs then it might work slow or like monolithic architecture. 
•	Despite of Monolithic Architecture Microservice needs more configured hardware as well as software because each service needs the one or more instance configured to run and there might be different architecture of instance because of microservice provides different technologies.
•	Developer has made some inter process communication for communication between the services so the services can use other services call.
